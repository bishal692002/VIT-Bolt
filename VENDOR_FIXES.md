# Vendor Dashboard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Orders Not Showing Issue**
**Problem**: Orders were placed but not showing in vendor dashboard.

**Root Causes**:
- Order detail API endpoint was using wrong path (`/api/order/` vs `/api/orders/`)
- Order detail endpoint had security restriction that only allowed customers to view orders
- Orders with pending payment were being hidden from the vendor
- The "Start Cooking" button only showed for paid orders

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint from `/api/order/:id` to `/api/orders/:id`
- ✅ Updated order detail security to allow vendors to view orders containing their food items
- ✅ Changed order display to show ALL orders regardless of payment status
- ✅ "Start Cooking" button now shows for all placed orders, but is disabled for unpaid orders with a tooltip

### 2. **Socket.IO Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Real-time updates not working properly.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added connection logging to track socket.io status
- ✅ Added connect, disconnect, and error event handlers
- ✅ Enhanced socket event handlers with detailed logging:
  - `menu_updated` - triggers menu refresh
  - `orders_updated` - triggers orders refresh with new order highlighting
  - `new_order` - shows notification and flashes overview tab

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**

**Enhanced Order Display**:
- ✅ Beautiful card-based layout for orders
- ✅ Clear payment status indicators (green for paid, red for pending)
- ✅ Status badges with color coding:
  - Placed: Yellow
  - Cooking: Blue
  - Ready: Green
  - Delivered: Green

- ✅ Hover effects and smooth transitions

**Enhanced Menu Display**:

**Dashboard Statistics**:
- ✅ Four stat cards with icons:
  - Total Orders
  - Revenue (₹)
  - Cooking
  - Ready for Pickup
- ✅ Hover animations
- ✅ Color-coded left border

### 4. **Order Detail Modal**
**Problem**: Order details not loading properly.

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Fixed API endpoint path
- ✅ Enhanced modal with:
  - Customer information
  - Delivery partner info (if assigned)
  - Complete delivery address
  - Itemized list with prices
  - Payment status
  - Total amount
  - Order timestamp

### 5. **Auto-Refresh**
**Added**:
- ✅ Orders auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Menu auto-refreshes every 60 seconds
- ✅ Manual refresh button available

### 6. **Error Handling**
**Improved**:
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Toast notifications instead of alerts
- ✅ Graceful error messages
- ✅ Empty state displays when no data
- ✅ Loading states during API calls

### 7. **Authentication**
**Enhanced**:
- ✅ Token validation on page load

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used
```javascript
GET    /api/vendor/orders         // Get all vendor's orders
POST   /api/vendor/orders/:id/status  // Update order status
GET    /api/orders/:id             // Get single order details
GET    /api/vendor/items           // Get vendor's menu items
POST   /api/vendor/items           // Create menu item
PUT    /api/vendor/items/:id       // Update menu item
DELETE /api/vendor/items/:id       // Delete menu item
GET    /api/categories             // Get available categories
```

### Order Status Flow
```
placed → cooking → ready → out_for_delivery → delivered
```

**Vendor can update**:
- `placed` → `cooking` (Start Cooking button)
- `cooking` → `ready` (Mark Ready button)

**System automatically updates**:
- `ready` → `out_for_delivery` (when rider accepts)
- `out_for_delivery` → `delivered` (when rider delivers)

### Payment Status Handling
- Orders with `payment.status === 'pending'` are shown but:
  - Cannot be moved to cooking status
  - "Start Cooking" button is disabled
  - Shows tooltip: "Waiting for payment"
- Orders with `payment.status === 'paid'` can be processed normally

### Socket.IO Events
**Emitted by Server**:
- `menu_updated` - When any menu item is created/updated/deleted
- `orders_updated` - When any order is created or status changes
- `new_order` - When a new order is placed

**Handled by Vendor Dashboard**:
- Automatically refreshes relevant data
- Shows visual notifications
- Highlights new/updated orders

## Database Query Logic

### Vendor Orders Query
```javascript
// Find all food items belonging to vendor
const vendorFoodIds = await FoodItem.find({ vendor: vendorId }).distinct('_id');

// Find orders containing any of vendor's food items
const orders = await Order.find({ 
  'items.food': { $in: vendorFoodIds } 
})
.populate('items.food')
.populate('user')
.populate('deliveryPartner')
.sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

### Today's Stats Calculation
```javascript
const todayStart = new Date();
todayStart.setHours(0,0,0,0);

const todayOrders = orders.filter(o => 
  new Date(o.createdAt) >= todayStart
);

const revenue = todayOrders.reduce((sum, order) => 
  sum + (order.payment?.status === 'paid' ? order.total : 0), 
  0
);
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ Order details modal shows all information
✅ Menu items display with images
✅ Can toggle stock status
✅ Can add/edit/delete menu items

## Known Limitations

1. **Payment Pending Orders**: Vendors can see but not process orders with pending payment
2. **Rider Assignment**: Vendors cannot assign riders (done automatically when rider accepts)
3. **Order Cancellation**: No cancel feature implemented yet
4. **Bulk Actions**: Cannot update multiple orders at once
5. **Export Data**: No export/download functionality
